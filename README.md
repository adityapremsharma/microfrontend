# Microfrontend demo

### To start the project:

  - Navigate to each folder and run -> npm i <br /><br />
  - Navigate back to root folder and run -> npm i and then run -> npm start <br /><br />
  - You can see the app running on port 3000. You can even run each app independently on the port defined in config/webpack.dev.js file for each app.
